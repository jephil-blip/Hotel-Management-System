## 💡 Notes for Postman Testing

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Create a variable in Postman named `base_url` with the value `http://localhost:5000/api`.
   - Use `{{base_url}}/rooms` in your requests for easier environment switching.

2. **Headers**
   - For `POST` and `DELETE` requests, include:
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

3. **Authorization (Optional)**
   - If your API uses authentication, include your token in:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
     ```

4. **Error Responses**
   - Invalid requests return structured error messages such as:
     ```json
     {
       "error": "Room not found"
     }
     ```
